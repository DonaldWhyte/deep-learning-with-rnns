## Running Presentation

You can also run the presentation on a local web server. Clone this repository and run the presentation like so:

```
npm install
grunt serve
```

The presentation can now be accessed on `localhost:8080`. Note that this web application is configured to bind to hostname `0.0.0.0`, which means that once the Grunt server is running, it will be accessible from external hosts as well (using the current host's public IP address).
